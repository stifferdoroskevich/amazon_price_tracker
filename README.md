# amazon_price_tracker


USAGE
It look for a price in amazon.com, and if the value is in the range you want, it sends an email using any email.
For the test I will use GMAIL. And the server configurations of GMAIL.

Requirements
1)Create a password for the gmail.
You will need to setup an application-specific password rather
than using your account-password - see:

1.A) enable second factor auth: https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185839

1.B)create app password: https://security.google.com/settings/security/apppasswords

2) pip install -r requirements.txt
